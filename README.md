## 🔐 1. User Authentication
### Tech:
- Firebase Auth (simplest, handles Google login & password auth) 
- Or: Auth0 (more robust, better role-based access)

### Features:
- Sign up / login / logout

- Google Auth integration

- Edit profile

- Delete account

## 🧠 2. Quiz System (CRUD + Categories)
### Tech:
- Node.js + Express.js REST API

- PostgreSQL for storing:

    - Users

    - Quizzes

    - Questions

    - Categories

    - Scores

    - Badges

- Use Sequelize ORM or Prisma for clean DB interaction

🚀 3. Real-Time Quizzes + Leaderboard
Tech:
Socket.IO for real-time quiz play, countdown, and leaderboard updates

Redis to store and update live leaderboard data quickly

Example:
One socket room per quiz

Clients join the room by quiz code

Countdown + questions emitted from server

Leaderboard recalculated live and pushed to clients

🎯 4. Quiz Logic + Scoring
Backend calculates:

Score based on correct answers and time left

Stores attempts per quiz

Tracks user quiz history

Assigns points to user account

Optional: Use serverless functions for scalable score calculations

🏅 5. Badges + Points
Logic on the backend:

Points added on correct answers

Milestones (100, 300, 500...) trigger badge unlocks

Store user badges in DB

Display badges with tooltips on profile

🧾 6. Admin Panel
Tech:
Use your existing React + Tailwind UI

Add Role-based access control to pages

Only admins can access /admin

Admin Features:

Manage quizzes/questions/categories (CRUD)

View analytics:

Number of quiz attempts

Avg score per quiz

Most popular quizzes

Bonus:
Use charting library like Recharts for score analytics in admin.

🌍 7. API Calls for Pre-Built MCQs
If questions come from an external API:

Use axios to call the API from backend

Transform & store in your DB for speed/reuse

Or: Build your own CMS for quiz content in admin panel

🧪 8. Testing & Reliability
Write unit tests using Jest (backend)

Use Postman to test your API routes

Add middleware for error handling and logging

🌐 9. Deployment

| Component | Suggested Service      |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| Frontend  | Vercel                 |
| Backend   | Render or Railway      |
| Database  | PostgreSQL (Render)    |
| Real-time | Socket.IO on Node      |
| Admin     | Part of React frontend |

🧠 Recommendations to Make It More Reliable
Use Role-based Access Control (RBAC) – Differentiate admin/user permissions.

Rate Limiting + Validation – Prevent abuse and bad data.

Session/Token Expiry – For secure auth (Firebase handles this well).

Quiz Code Expiry – Auto-expire shared quiz codes after session ends.

Database Indexes – On frequently queried fields like user_id, quiz_id.

Backups – Use PostgreSQL auto-backup on Render/Railway.
